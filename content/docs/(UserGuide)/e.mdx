4.	After filling in all fields, click the “Create Class” button to save the class. You will get confirmation once the class is successfully created.

### Error Report Workflow

This page allows the admin to review and manage all student-reported errors.
The super admin is responsible for verifying whether the reported error is valid and acting when necessary. The error report table includes the following columns:

For each pending report, there is a “Resolve” button. The following happens when the **admin** clicks the button:

-	A modal opens, allowing them to confirm and process the correction.
-	Within the modal, click “Resolve Report” to finalise the update.
-	Once submitted, the status is updated from Pending to Resolved.
