## Dashboard Overview

The Student Dashboard provides students with direct access to their academic records, certificates, and reporting tools. It is designed for simplicity, allowing quick actions such as viewing results, generating transcripts, and downloading or sharing certificates.

## Navigation Panel

Located on the left-hand side, students can access the following key sections:

-	Dashboard: The main page displaying the student’s academic record and certificate actions.
-	Report Errors: Allows the student to report discrepancies in their academic data.
-	Report Errors List: Displays all error reports the student has submitted for tracking.
-	Generate Transcript: Enables the student to generate and download a transcript of their academic history.

## Student Details View

At the top of the dashboard, the student sees their full name prominently displayed (e.g. “Adekunle Akinjide”). A table summarising their result entry is below that. This table includes the following:

-	Serial Number (S/N).
-	Student Name.
-	Candidate Number.

## Result Options

Buttons provided at the top of the student panel allow filtering by result type:

•	Preview Result (Red): Possibly for draft or unverified results.
•	Regular Result (Green): Official academic results.
•	Regional Exam (Grey): Regionally coordinated results (if applicable).
•	Filters for Academic Session and Class Type help narrow down the displayed results.

## Certificate Actions

To the right of the student’s result, there are three buttons offering certificate-related actions:

-	Download Certificate: Save a copy of the certificate locally.
-	Share Certificate: Generates a shareable link or email option.
-	Save Certificate: Option to save the certificate securely on the platform (for easy access later).

## Search

The Search Bar at the top of the Student Dashboard is designed to help students quickly locate academic records or specific certificate entries without manually browsing through a long list.

As the student types into the Search Bar, the Results Table dynamically updates in real time to match the search query:

1.	Log in to the EduCert platform as an examiner.
2.	At the top of the page, locate the Search Bar (top-left of the screen, beside the DiCert logo).
3.	Click the Search Bar and type in the search query. When you are done, press “Enter”. The system dynamically returns entries that match your search criteria.
4.	Once the desired result appears, click the “Preview” button to view the result details.


---

## Filter

The Filter Feature on the Student Dashboard allows students to narrow down certificate records based on specific academic criteria, such as session or class type. This is particularly useful for students who have results or certificates across multiple sessions or education levels.

1.	Log in to the EduCert platform as a student.
2.	At the top-right corner of the dashboard, locate the Academic Session and/or Class Type dropdown.
3.	To filter by year, use the Academic Session dropdown to select the year (e.g. 2022).
4.	To filter by class, use the Class Type dropdown to select the year (e.g. 2022).

Selecting an option from either or both filters will refresh the table to show only matching results.
