The super admin is the highest-level user on the EduCert platform. They oversee platform-wide activities and manage data access across all states and user categories. They also ensure that the system operates smoothly across schools, LGAs, and state agencies.

Super admins do not generate certificates directly but play a critical role in managing access, resolving escalations, and maintaining system integrity.

### Data Filter Options

The super admin can filter dashboard data using the date range selector to review platform activity trends across different timeframes:

- Annual
- Quarter
- Month
- Today
- Custom Range

### Dashboard Metrics

Based on the selected timeframe, the super admin can monitor the following indicators:

- **Total Number of Teachers**: Displays the total count of registered teachers across all schools.
- **Total Number of Inspectors**: Shows the number of state-level or LGA-level inspectors registered on the platform.
- **Total Number of Examiners**: Shows the number of examiners on the platform.
- **Total Number of Schools**: Shows the number of schools on the platform.
- **School Signups Rate**: Shows the growth rate in school registration, with percentage indicators and trend arrows.
