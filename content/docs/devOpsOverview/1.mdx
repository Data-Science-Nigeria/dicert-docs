## Tools and Technologies

### NPM
**npm** is a widely used tool for building code that works with the `package.json` file.  
We use it to install the required dependencies for the project.

---

### Docker
In our project, we are using a container deployment and **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** deployment for the backend service, microservices, and frontend of the site.

- After cloning the repo, we build a new image on every **push** event to the repository.
- **Docker Compose** is used for deploying the code on the server.
- Each newly built image is stored on the **AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**.

---

### Docker Compose
For deploying the code on the server, we have a separate `docker-compose.yml` file.

- This file is triggered with GitHub Actions workflow and uses the latest built image from a push event.
- Different ports are allocated for the frontend and backend containers.
- Each container has its own Docker Compose file.

---

### PostgreSQL
We use a containerised setup and **AWS RDS** with a PostgreSQL database for backend data storage.

- Daily backups are implemented in AWS RDS.
- A Docker volume is added for backups and data retrieval.
- Separate PostgreSQL databases exist for each environment:

  - **Quality Assurance (QA)**: Containerised.
  - **Development (Dev)**: Containerised.
  - **Production (Prod)**: Private instance.

---

### AWS
We have adopted **AWS Cloud** for:

- Configuring virtual machines (VMs)
- Storing database data
- Monitoring servers
- Checking logs for containers
- Providing user access to AWS resources

Resources used in the project include:

- **EC2**
- **AWS S3**
- **IAM**
- **CloudWatch**

---

### EC2
We use **Amazon EC2** to launch servers in different environments such as development, staging, and production.

- Various VM types are selected with different configurations.
- Each VM has a separate **security group** for server access.

---

### AWS S3
We use **AWS S3** for storing certificates (Verifiable Credentials) in an S3 bucket.

---

### IAM
To provide users with **limited access** to specific resources:

- IAM roles are created with **read-only permissions** for CloudWatch Logs streams.
- Custom policies are defined to grant access to specific resources with specific permissions.
